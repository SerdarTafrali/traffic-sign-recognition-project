# Traffic Sign Recognition Project ðŸš¦

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for traffic sign recognition. Using advanced techniques and a structured pipeline, we aim to accurately classify traffic signs from a given dataset. The project leverages radial basis function (RBF) kernels with support vector machines (SVMs), hyperparameter optimization, and thorough evaluation to achieve high classification performance.

## Key Features of the Project

- **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline**:
  - Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, and splitting).
  - Model training using RBF kernel SVMs.
  - Hyperparameter optimization with `GridSearchCV`.
  - Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Visualization of results using confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project contains images of various traffic signs. Each image is labeled with its corresponding class.
- Images were resized to 32x32 pixels and normalized for consistency and optimal training.

## Model

- **Base Model**:
  - Initial training was done using default parameters of an SVM with an RBF kernel.
- **Optimized Model**:
  - Hyperparameters such as `C` (regularization) and `gamma` (kernel coefficient) were fine-tuned using `GridSearchCV` to improve performance.

## Evaluation

- The optimized model achieved an accuracy of **91.76%**, with significant improvements in class-specific metrics compared to the base model.
- Detailed analysis of confusion matrices revealed improved classification for both high- and low-support classes.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing
- Images were resized, normalized, and split into training and test sets.
- The data was further standardized using `StandardScaler` for optimal performance with SVM.

### Base Model Training
- The initial SVM model was trained with default parameters as a benchmark.

### Hyperparameter Optimization
- Using `GridSearchCV`, the parameters `C` and `gamma` were fine-tuned to achieve a balance between bias and variance.

### Performance Evaluation
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed.
- Confusion matrices were visualized to identify misclassifications and model strengths.

### Visualization
- Confusion matrices and classification reports were generated to provide insights into the modelâ€™s performance.

- **Base Model**:
  - Accuracy: **88.22%**
  - Precision: **89.76%**
  - Recall: **88.22%**
  - F1-Score: **88.43%**
- **Optimized Model**:
  - Accuracy: **91.76%**
  - Precision: **92.28%**
  - Recall: **91.76%**
  - F1-Score: **91.78%**

The optimized model demonstrates significant improvements across all metrics, especially in challenging low-support classes.

## Tools and Technologies
